# Testing

## Functionality testing 

 I used Opera web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## Compatibility testing
 Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in both Opera web developer tolls and Chrome developer tools. 
 
 I tested on hardware devices such as: Asus ROG Zephyrus running Kali linux and Windows OS's, Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, Google pixel 2XL Running Android 11.

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
Used Ctrl+Shift+N so the test is accurate and no cached data is stored. Screenshot is presented below:

## User stories testing

### As a website owner:

- I would like to present myself and my skillset on the website clearly for potential employers.
    > Name, Surname, current position and a breaf description is given, as well as a whole About page, where users can see more information about the candidate.

- I need to make sure that my current and new customers will find all the information relevant to their search.
    > About page if continuesly being updated as new skills/education or work experience is gained. 

- I want for potential employers to be able to download my CV if it's necessary.
    > Each page has a download button in the Navigation bar, where potential employer can easily download my up to date CV.

- I want my website visitors to be able to learn how to use my website intuitively and easily.
    > Each page has a Navigation bar, where the user can easily return to either home page or to any other. The design is very minimalistic, not to draw attention from the main content and not to overload the user with abundance of information.


### As a new user:
- I wish to find information about this person and see his qualifications.
    > New users visiting Home page, have a my name/surname my current position as well as a breaf description of my duties and responsibilities.

- I would like to contact said person for future inquires.
    > New users can find that they can easily contact me via the contact page form or via the social media links left in the footer on each page of the website. 

- I want to be able to download this persons CV for future reference. 
    > Users visiting the website can easily spot the download button located in the Navigation bar, where the up to date CV is located.

### As a returning customer:
- I wish to check if there are any changes, such as new skills or education/work experience.
    > The Main and About page, as well as CV that is available via the download button is constantly being updated.

- I would like to get in touch with the website owner (potential future employee)
    > Like the new user, returning users have the same options when it comes to contacting me, via the contact form or via the social media links.

## Issues found during site development

* #### Navbar scaling issues on Iphone 11

Could not reproduce bug where peer reported a bug that the navbar did not scale well on Iphone 11. (The download button was out of the screen)

* #### Footer overlapping contact windows form on laptops.

Peer found a bug, where footer overlapped the contact form.

![testing_issue_2](./Assets/readme_img/footer_bug.png)

Made a minor adjustment to the footer container by changing the position from fixed to position:sticky;
