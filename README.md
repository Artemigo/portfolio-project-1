## Deployment

I've deployed My portfolio website on GitHub pages.

These were the steps I used to deploy my website: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - Select Pages in the left handside menu
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch and root folder
  - Once the main branch and root folder have been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
